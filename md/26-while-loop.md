WHILE LOOP
JS-FILE

while loop if we want to write 1 thing in 100 times then we use loops are stands in three step

initialize
     |
condition
     |
increment / decrement 
LOOPES
LOOP IS DIVIDED IN 3 PARTS (INITIALIZATION , CONDITION INCREMENT OR DECREMENT ) 1 -> INITIALIZATION IS HAVE TO MAKE THAT ONE VALUE THAT WE HAVE TO RUN 2 -> CONDITION IF CONDITION IS TRUE THE THIRD PART IS USABLE IF CONDITION IS FALSE THE 3RD PART IS NOT USABLE 3 -> THE THIRD PART IS INCREMNT , DECREMENT IF YOU WANT TO COME UPER TO LOWER THEN USE DECREMENT AND IF U WANT TO COME LOWER TO UPER THE USE INCREMENT THERE ARE FIVE (5) TYPE OF LOOS

so this pa ttern is to make while loop

increment loop
var a = 1;
while(a <= 10){
<!-- 
document.write(a+") my name is mujahid khan");
document.write("<br>");
a = a +1;
}

dicrement loop
var b = 10;
while(b >= 1){
    document.write(b+")mujahid khan");
    document.write("<br>");
    b--
} -->
