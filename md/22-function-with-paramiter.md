THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FUNTION AND FUNTION WITH PARAMETER WE HAVE TO ADD PARREMETER TO FUNTION BECOUSE IF WE HAVE TO WRITE SAME THING WITH OTERS VALUE

var a = 5;
var b = 10;
 document.write(a+b);
 ---
 ---
 var a = 100;
var b = 200;
 document.write(a+b);
 ---
 ---
 var a = 20;
var b = 30;
 document.write(a+b);
 ---
 ---
so this is how we change the value so the pattern to add parameter is

function para(fname , lname){
     document.write("hello  " + fname + "" + lname );
}
para("adnan  " , "chouhan");
the end
